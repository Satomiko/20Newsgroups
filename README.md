# Developing TExt Classification MOdels usin the 20Newsgroups Dataset

The main problem of this project is to build text classificatio models that can accurately classify text samples in to one of the distinct categories. 
The project uses "Twenty Newsgroups" dataset available through scikit-learn at (<a href="https://scikit-learn.org/0.19/datasets/twenty_newsgroups.html" target="_blank">[Scikit-Learn Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/0.19/datasets/twenty_newsgroups.html)https://scikit-learn.org/0.19/datasets/twenty_newsgroups.html</>)
